PBHD Project Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
The PBHD project is focused on **streamlining IT service management using Jira**. The goal is to **automate ticket assignments, improve SLA tracking, and enhance reporting.**

To improve the efficiency and organization of the **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) team**, I designed and implemented a **centralized ticketing system** in Jira. This system enables all team members to **easily track and manage tasks**, consolidating various aspects of RCM operations, including:
- **Billing inquiries**  
- **Payment issues**  
- **Service disputes**  

By integrating these processes into one cohesive platform, the PBHD project ensures **improved visibility, better task prioritization, and faster issue resolution** for the RCM team.
