## 📜 **Background & Problem Statement**
Kindbody’s **Holistic Health and 360 Appointment booking system** had several **inefficiencies**:
1️⃣ **Duplicate appointment types** confused patients & providers.  
2️⃣ **No provider licensing restrictions** led to **wrong bookings** in unlicensed states.  
3️⃣ **Patients from Texas** couldn't book correctly due to **market selection limitations**.  
4️⃣ **Inconsistent appointment modifiers** made it difficult for providers to categorize services.

✅ **Removed redundant appointment types** to simplify provider selection.  
✅ **Enabled auto-market selection by ZIP code** for improved location accuracy.  
✅ **Restricted provider availability** to only licensed states.
